Our names are Ritvik Sajja, Sanchit Gupta, Aneesh Gadgil.
This is our Housing Web Application to help connect Students and Real Estate Managers to help the student find the perfect home near campus.

Start Page: 
Upon running the application, the user should be able to see our home page - a registration page. 
Depending on your history with our application, you may take any of the following steps:

Case 1: If you are a new user, regardless of whether you are a manager or student, you should fill out your email, username (at least 5 characters), and password(at least 8 characters) to register for a new account. To submit this information, make sure to click on the button titled ''. Make sure to record your username and password somewhere, as you will need this to login in the future. As this is your first time sign-in, upon login, you will be directed to your dashboard.

Case 2: If you are an existing student/manager, you should classify yourself by clicking on either of the relevant buttons: "Already a student" or "Already a manager". By selecting the relevant one, you should be able to access your sign-in portal, where you can enter your username/password and select "Sign in" to access your dashboard.

Student Dashboard:

When a new user accesses the student dashboard for the first time, they will not be able to view/launch the marketplace until they fill out the preference form. The preference form can be accessed by clicking on the 'Tasks' button located on the task bar. Upon access of the empty preference form, the user should see fields for a variety of relevant housing properties for them to express their ideal accommodation. These properties include, but are not limited to: desired number of bedrooms, desired number of bathrooms, desired distance to campus, etc.
